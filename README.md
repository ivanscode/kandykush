KandyKrush (Version 2.1)

The app is available on the Google Play store (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ivan.is.awesome.kandykrush)

You can use the source code for whatever you need.
It's basically a foundation for any soundboard you want. Just change the source files and boom.
If you want, you can give a minor shoutout to me in whatever you develop off of this. If not, don't care.
Have fun coding
